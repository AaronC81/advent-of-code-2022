# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles. This year I'm trying to write them in
[Babble](https://github.com/AaronC81/babble), my own experimental programming language, as a way to
get a feel for writing proper programs in it!

To run a solution:

```
babble -f solutions/dayX.bbl
```
